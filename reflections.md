A description of what security vulnerabilities may be in your application:

Using unencrypted communication with ws instead of wss could allow hackers to intercept/read the communication between the client and server.

There is also no input validation for the message or username that is being sent to the server. Users could input malicious scripts, code, or database requests.

what you learned from this exercise.

I learned about using javascript to run a server and running that server through the command line. I learned how to use an html file to send messages to the server, and how to compose that message fromt he contents of 2 different text fields. I leanred how to use sockets, and sockets correlated with urls and local host.
